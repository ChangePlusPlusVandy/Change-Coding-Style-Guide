## General Rules
- Use a maximum line width of 80-100 characters
- Indents should be five spaces
- Start and end braces from a new line
- Have a [README](https://github.com/juyoungkim304/Change-Black-and-Latinx-Directory/blob/master/README.md) in every GitHub repository with the following:
  - Name of project
  - Summary of what it does
  - Necessary dependencies and installation tutorial
  - Outline of application features
  - Names/contacts of contributors
  - Update history (if relevant)

## Naming Conventions
- Constants should be fully capitalized
- All other portions of code should be in camel case
- Keep names/identifiers concise but detailed
- Many languages have specific naming conventions - look [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_convention_(programming)) for some ideas
  
## Commenting
- Avoid over or under commenting - the goal is to clearly explain what your code does with the least amount of text!
- You should focus on commenting important functions or files
- Any multi-line comments should be in block-comment format

```
   // Single line comments should be formatted like this
   
   # Or like this (check the commenting standards of your language)
   
   /* While larger blocks of comments should be commented like this. 
      Note that the comments are now in block-comment format.
   */
```

## Code Cleanup
- Use linters to facilitate code cleanup:
  - C++ - clang-format
    - [Here](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) is a guide to set up clang-format on a variety of IDEs
  - Javascript - ESLint
    - [Here](https://medium.com/@RossWhitehouse/setting-up-eslint-in-react-c20015ef35f7) is a guide to set up ESLint in React
    - [Here](https://medium.com/fantageek/setting-up-eslint-and-editorconfig-in-react-native-projects-31b4d9ddd0f6) is a guide to set up ESLint in React Native

## Hosting
